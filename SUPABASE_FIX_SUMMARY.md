# Supabase Database Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **HTTP 406 Errors**: Content negotiation issues with daily_drugs queries
2. **HTTP 403 Errors**: Permission denied accessing daily_drugs table
3. **App Initialization Failures**: Database access issues preventing app startup
4. **Missing RLS Policies**: Row Level Security policies not properly configured
5. **Authentication Race Conditions**: App trying to initialize before user authentication settled

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in AppContext
- **File**: `src/context/AppContext.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added proper authentication checks before initialization
  - Improved error handling with graceful degradation
  - Added timeout to allow authentication to settle
  - Prevented initialization loops
  - Better error messages for users

### 2. Improved Daily Drug Service
- **File**: `src/services/supabaseService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced `getDailyDrug()` function with better error handling
  - Used `maybeSingle()` instead of `single()` to handle missing records
  - Added fallback mechanisms when daily drug creation fails
  - Improved logging for debugging
  - Added batch processing for drug data initialization

### 3. Database Schema and RLS Policies
- **File**: `fix-database.sql`
- **Purpose**: Complete database setup script
- **Includes**:
  - All required table structures
  - Proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies
  - Correct permissions for authenticated users
  - Performance indexes
  - Schema refresh commands

## Required Actions

### 1. Run Database Fix Script
Execute the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-database.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

### 2. Verify Authentication Settings
In Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings:
- Ensure Site URL is set to `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
- Verify that email authentication is enabled
- Check that anonymous sign-ins are enabled if needed

### 3. Test the Application
1. Clear browser cache and local storage
2. Restart the development server: `npm start`
3. Try signing in with a test account
4. Verify that the app initializes without errors

## Key Improvements

### Error Handling
- App no longer crashes on database connection issues
- Graceful degradation when optional features fail
- Better user feedback with meaningful error messages

### Authentication Flow
- Proper waiting for authentication to settle
- Prevention of multiple initialization attempts
- Clear separation between authenticated and unauthenticated states

### Database Queries
- More robust daily drug selection
- Better handling of missing data
- Improved RLS policy coverage

### Performance
- Batch processing for large data operations
- Proper database indexes
- Optimized query patterns

## Testing Checklist

After applying fixes, verify:

- [ ] App loads without console errors
- [ ] User can sign in successfully
- [ ] Daily drug loads correctly
- [ ] System stats display properly
- [ ] No more 403/406 errors in network tab
- [ ] Database operations work as expected

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Supabase Project Status**: Ensure your project is active
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Confirm `.env` file has correct values
3. **Review Browser Console**: Look for specific error messages
4. **Check Network Tab**: Monitor API calls for error responses
5. **Supabase Logs**: Review logs in Supabase dashboard

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- All existing data will be preserved
- RLS policies ensure proper data isolation
- Performance should be improved with new indexes

## Support

If you continue experiencing issues:
1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Review the Supabase dashboard for database logs
3. Ensure all SQL commands executed successfully
4. Verify your Supabase project has sufficient resources
